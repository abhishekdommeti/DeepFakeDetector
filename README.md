# DeepFakeDetector
Detecting deepfakes in videos using deep learning is the core goal of this project. We leverage transfer learning with a pretrained ResNeXt CNN to extract visual features. These features are passed to an LSTM layer that learns temporal patterns across frames. Together, they form a robust pipeline for accurate deepfake identification.
